# CompressPublishPlugin

Pre-process a [Publish](https://github.com/johnsundell/publish) website before placing on a server for bandwidth efficiency.

The main use of this is to deploy to nginx that will serve the .gz compressed versions of files to reduce loading time and bandwidth costs for browsers that support compression.
